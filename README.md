Project: All-in-One Job Portal

Problem Statement : Job seekers often face the overwhelming task of visiting multiple websites to find information essential for their job search. 
They may need to search one platform for job listings, another for interview experiences, yet another for salary structures, and still others for resume templates or referrals. 
This scattered process is both time-consuming and frustrating, as users are forced to switch between sites to get comprehensive information and resources.

Solution : Our website aims to be the ultimate one-stop solution for job seekers, centralizing all essential resources in a single platform. 
Our platform aggregates live job listings 24/7 from multiple sources (such as LinkedIn, Naukri, and others) and presents them in an easily navigable format with powerful filters, 
such as job type (QA, Developer, DevOps, Internship), experience level, and location, to help users quickly find relevant roles.

In addition to job listings, users can access and contribute interview experiences, salary structures, and referral opportunities to foster a community of shared knowledge. 
Our platform also provides curated resume templates and allows users to upload their resumes for guidance and inspiration.
